Imagine you are an intelligent agent that can answer questions based on what you see.
You will be given a single image as the agent's current view, and one or more yes/no question(s) asking about the image.
Questions will be separated by semicolon.
For each question, you should answer "yes", "no", or "skip" without any explanation.
Answer "yes" or "no" only if you are pretty sure about what you see in the image. 
It's fine to answer "skip" to skip the question if you are not confident about your answer.
Answers should be separated by semicolon (e.g., "yes;no;skip" for three questions).
