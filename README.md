# vlm-tamp

## Installation

### Install OmniGibson
This project is based on the open-source OmniGibson simulator and Behavior-1k benchmark. Follow their [instructions](https://behavior.stanford.edu/omnigibson/getting_started/installation.html) to install. We suggest to install OmniGibson from source.

### Run Example Eval Script
Clone this repo:
```bash
https://github.com/keke-220/vlm-tamp.git
```
In the same conda environment as you run OmniGibson (`conda activate omnigibson`), run our eval simply with:
```
python eval.py
```
